This is my first Python project. It recreates the FIFA lounge mode from older versions of FIFA.
With it, you can maintain a league table (for FIFA, football, or any other form of competition).
It currently has the following features:
                                        Record a result which:
                                              Updates the league table
                                              Stores the result in the results archive
                                        Display the league table
                                        Display the full history of results
                                        Add a new team to the league
                                        Remove a team from the league
When recording a new result, you can either:
                                      Input the two team names from the league of your choice OR
                                      Have one or more of the teams selected at random
